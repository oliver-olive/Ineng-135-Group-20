## Description of the python file -- linear regression 
At the beginning of this project, we were considering whether metal prices are linearly 
increasing with time or not, because we know metals like gold are assets for protection against Inflation. To prove this thought, we decided to pick gold as a reference, so we collected the monthly prices of gold from 1950 to July 2020. We split the data by 90% for training and 10 % for testing.  After that, we used a linear regression model from sklearn to build a linear model. We used this model to predict the values from 1950 to 2020,  and we plotted the line of prediction with the scatter of actual values, we could easily observe that the price of gold doesn't have a strong linear association with time. This graph disproofs our thought, even though the overall price went up with time, but it was choppy in the progress. We can see the price exploded more quadratically at some moments for some reasons and had retracements after the explosions.(Next) After that observation, we calculated  the mean square errors for the training set and testing set, which are huge, around 60000.

## Description of python file -- PCA model
Description content
Since we are team of analysis the different precious metals, we are trying to use another model to predict our data call pca. It is a dimensionality-reduction method that is often used to reduce the dimensionality of large data sets, by transforming a large set of variables into a smaller one that still contains most of the information in the large set.
